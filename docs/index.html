    <h1>OFFICIAL STATEMENT</h1>
    <p>PIFC has ceased operations to officially merge with our dear partner, FaithChatt Forum. We believe their ministry is more capable and accommodating to shape believers of the Christian faith through the Bible alone. At the same time, the online scene in the Filipino church defending the Gospel is more prominent to Facebook groups and local Bible-based churches, which built weakness in this community.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, our current staff team will become regular members whenever they want to join. The good news, your new home will have more bible studies and prayer sessions worth participating in. Staff from FaithChatt consists of elders, pastors, professors, and other faithful evangelical ambassadors of the Gospel. I, the Filipino representation of FC, welcome you to this breed of believers and those who want true salvation.</p>
    <p>Being on Christian Discord meta has been a long journey. Moving forward, I will refocus on my local church's music ministry. They're in dire need of new disciples who want to use their talents for the glory of God. Huge thank our members who have not only contributed their passion for sharing the Gospel, but it transformed my life when I needed the most, all glory to God alone.</p>
    <p>Bearing the words of Apostle Paul in 2 Timothy 4:1-8, we hope and pray that may the holy fire continue to burn as we progress biblically and finish the race, a good fight of faith. For our Lord Jesus Christ. For our beloved Republic of the Philippines. Maraming salamat at mabuhay kayong lahat, mga kapwang mananampalataya!</p>
    <p>Your servant in the Lord,<br>Stephen L.</p>
